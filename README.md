# Getting Starting with Vanilla Template

- `index.html` is where you include the D3 library, your D3 code, and any HTML 
- `scatterplot.js` is an example of a visualization you would create. It writes to the `#scatterplot` SVG element.
- `cars.csv` is the data we're loading. It could be a JSON file or an API endpoint. 

## Running your code 

Spin up a simple python server (depending on python version) to host your code: 

- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000`
- `python3 -m http.server 4000`
